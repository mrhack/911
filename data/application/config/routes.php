| URI ROUTING
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This file lets you re-map URI requests to specific controller functions.
|
| Typically there is a one-to-one relationship between a URL string
| and its corresponding controller class/method. The segments in a
| URL normally follow this pattern:
|
|	example.com/class/method/id/
|
| In some instances, however, you may want to remap this relationship
| so that a different class/function is called than the one
| corresponding to the URL.
|
| Please see the user guide for complete details:
|
|	http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/routing.html
|
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------
| RESERVED ROUTES
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| There area two reserved routes:
|
|	$route['default_controller'] = 'welcome';
|
| This route indicates which controller class should be loaded if the
| URI contains no data. In the above example, the "welcome" class
| would be loaded.
|
|	$route['404_override'] = 'errors/page_missing';
|
| This route will tell the Router what URI segments to use if those provided
| in the URL cannot be matched to a valid route.
|

$route['default_controller'] = "welcome";
$route['404_override'] = '';
$route['backup_form'] = 'welcome/backup_form';
$route['backup_form_submit'] = 'welcome/backup_form_submit';
$route['download'] = 'welcome/download_database';
$route['initialize_database'] = 'welcome/initialize_database';
// Share
$route["share"] = "welcome/share_with_email"; 
$route["share_form_submit"] = "welcome/share_form_submit";
